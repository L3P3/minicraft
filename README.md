# Minicraft

Minecraft, but based on ray tracing and written in JavaScript.

A game begun by early 2019 by @L3P3 after [proof of concept](https://l3p3.de/z/minicraft.html).

Heavily inspired by and somewhat based on the work of @xNotch.

Written for [bake.js](https://l3p3.de/dok/bake.html) but will be ported to normal ES module syntax. Hopefully soon, to get this thing working!

## Build instructions

```shell
bake mc.cjs
```

But the game did not work anyway. And bake was never released so there is no real point in this section.
