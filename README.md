## How to use while developing

I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code and the extension "Live Server". Then open "app-dev.html" to see the result.

## Build instructions

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## My tools

- Windows XP
- Mypal browser + its devtools
- VS Code via [code-server](https://github.com/cdr/code-server)
- Live Server extension
- [lui web framework](https://github.com/L3P3/lui)

## Contribution

This is not really supposed to be a community project, do not assume it would be easy to get pull requests merged by me. But I am really happy to answer any questions or getting any kind of feedback. Feel free to open issues or suggest changes by opening a pull request!

## License

Just ZLib license, I do not care too much about it.

This game includes slightly modified textures from Minecraft, which is of course owned by Microsoft. Since this is a purely educational project, I deem this fair use.
