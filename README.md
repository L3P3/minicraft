# Minicraft

Minecraft, but based on ray tracing and written in JavaScript. Yes, it is a game and I am not a gamer but this is also very educational.

[Try it out now!](https://l3p3.de/minicraft)

A game begun by early 2019 by [@L3P3](https://github.com/L3P3) after [proof of concept](https://l3p3.de/z/minicraft.html).

Heavily inspired by and somewhat based on the work of [@xNotch](https://github.com/xNotch).

Originally written for [bake.js](https://l3p3.de/dok/bake.html) but it is getting ported to normal ES module syntax and my web framework [lui](https://github.com/L3P3/lui), in order to get this thing working!

I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code and the extension "Live Server". Then open "app-dev.html" to see the result.
